## What

Prophesizer runs continuously, waking every 5 minutes to check the clock. When it wakes in the :45-:50 window of an hour, it does the following:

1) Get the latest data from the Blaseball `/games` endpoint and store it in the `games` table
2) Query S3 for all available log files
3) Check these against the database (`imported_logs` table) to see which are new
4) Process the log files in two big batches: "hourly" logs and "update" logs:

### Hourly logs

These are archives of all the standard public endpoints taken multiple times per hour (naming, eh).

Prophesizer cares about the `players` and `teams` structures only at this point, and does the following:

1) Add entries to `teams` for any team data changes (like name changes)
2) Add entries to `team_roster` to reflect any lineup/rotation/etc changes
3) Add entries to `team_modifications` to reflect any new "tags" (like the blood bath tags) for a team
4) Add entries to `players` for any player data changes (names, attributes)
5) Add entries to `player_modifications` for any new "tags" (like SHELLED) for a player

### Update logs

These are logs of the individual (one every ~4seconds) `streamData` updates for gameplay.

Prophesizer sends these through [Cauldron](https://github.com/Society-for-Internet-Blaseball-Research/Cauldron) to convert them into SIBR's "Game Event" format.

Game Events roughly correspond to one at-bat (with some exceptions like a runner caught stealing) and are more easily queried than the raw JSON updates from the stream.

These Game Events are added to the `game_events` table, with child tables `game_event_base_runners` for baserunning information and `outcomes` for Outcome (incineration, peanuts, partying, etc).

## Installation

The following instructions are written for Windows PCs.

1. Prophesizer depends on [git](https://git-scm.com/), [PostgreSQL](https://www.postgresql.org/), [Visual Studio Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/), and [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/en/). You can manually download and install all of these, but if you have the package manager [Chocolatey](https://chocolatey.org/) installed, you can automatically install these tools by opening a prompt (cmd/powershell) as administrator and running: `choco install git postgresql vscode nodejs`
2. Use git to clone Prophesizer from github into your desired directory: `git clone https://github.com/Society-for-Internet-Blaseball-Research/prophesizer/`. 
3. To access the S3 bucket where processed data is archived, you'll need an [AWS](https://aws.amazon.com/) account. This is different from an Amazon account. If you don't already have one, sign up (at no cost), go to your account dropdown to "My Security Credentials", and then select Access Keys. Use the dialog to create a new access key. It will display your new credentials — *don't lose them*, since they won't be shown to you again. Set them as the environment variables AWS_KEY and AWS_SECRET: `setx AWS_KEY [string]; setx AWS_SECRET [string]`
4. Set the environment PSQL_CONNECTION_STRING to "Host=localhost;username=[postgres username, default 'postgres'];password=[postgres password];database=blaseball", with `setx`, making appropriate changes if any are necessary.
3. Make sure psql is added to PATH (you can test by typing it in as a command), and your C# connection string and AWS key environment variables are correctly set.
4. In the directory prophesizer\\db, run `node schema.js load` to get your database ready to receive data from Prophesizer.
5. Compile and run Prophesizer from VS Code via File -> Open Folder, selecting Prophesizer's folder, going to 'Run' in the menu bar, and selecting "Run Without Debugging".
6. If at some point you make changes to the schema you wish to commit to a repository using `git`, in the directory prophesizer\\db, run `node schema.js dump` to dump your database's schema to schema.sql.
